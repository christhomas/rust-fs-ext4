# THE FIXTURE LIST lives here (IMAGES below) and in chores.yml's
# `fixtures` generates:, which must name the same files.
#
# Every fixture here needs the real kernel's ext4 driver to populate it,
# so the work happens in the fs-linux-test-harness VM (the sibling
# checkout at ../fs-linux-test-harness, moved to its pinned ref by
# `chore siblings`): test-disks/guest-build-images.sh runs as root in the
# guest, writes finished images into the shared directory, and this
# script moves them into test-disks/ on the host.
#
# The VM comes down when this script exits (FLTH_KEEP_VM=1 keeps it up
# for a quicker next run).
