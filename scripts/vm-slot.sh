#   vm-slot.sh status      say who holds it and for how long
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS. These VMs are not small: this one asks for 4 GB and
# the NTFS Windows box asks for 8. Two of them plus a `cargo test` fills
# a laptop, and when it fills, the machine does not fail cleanly -- it
# starts killing background work. That is exactly what happened on the
# night several agents were building fixtures in parallel: two VMs left
# running for hours, and unrelated jobs killed for want of memory with
# no message that connected the two.
#
# So the slot is deliberately a single global one rather than one per
# repository. The cost is real and worth stating: fixture builds in
# different repositories no longer overlap, and a queued build waits for
# the one ahead of it. That is slower on a good day and much better on a
# bad one, because the failure it removes was silent and the cost it
# adds is visible.
#
# The state lives outside every repository, because the whole point is
# that repositories do not know about each other.

# THERE IS NO "BREAKING POINT" ANY MORE. A second timeout used to take
# the slot from anyone holding it past 90 minutes regardless of whether

#     "dead" on an empty directory.

# So a waiter arriving in that window broke the lock of a process that
