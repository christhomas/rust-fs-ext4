# guest-suite.sh [cargo test args...] — THE WHOLE SUITE, INSIDE THE VM.
#
# The fs-linux-test-harness [test] guest_command: `chore test:vm` (and
# `chore test` on a host that is not Linux) boots the VM and runs this
# from /repo, where the harness mounts this repository.
#
# WHY IT EXISTS. We run the Linux tests on Linux. On a Linux host that is
# the host itself and this is not used. On a Mac there is no ext4, no
# e2fsprogs worth trusting and no loop mount — so the suite runs in here,
# against the same sources, with the same pinned toolchain.
#
# The toolchain and the build directory live on the VM's own disk
# (/var/lib, /var/cache), which outlives `vm:down` and is thrown away by
# `vm:destroy`: the first run pays a full build, later runs are
# incremental. The repository itself is a 9p mount, so nothing is written
# back into it except what the tests write to tmp/.

# sibling on the share (from its pinned, clean checkout) and this links
# it into place. `chore siblings` is what keeps it at the right ref.
