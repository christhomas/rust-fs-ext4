# SCRATCH LIVES IN THE REPOSITORY, always: tmp/ (gitignored), and never
# the system temporary directory or a runner-supplied one. The oracle
# tools run inside the fs-linux-test-harness VM, which sees this
# repository at the path the host knows it by and nothing else of the
# host — so an image anywhere else is a path the tool asked to read it
# cannot open. The same rule is written in Rust in
# tests/support/src/lib.rs (select_temp_dir), and
# tests/test_temp_policy.rs checks it.

# FS_EXT4_TEST_TMPDIR supplies an exact directory instead; it must be
