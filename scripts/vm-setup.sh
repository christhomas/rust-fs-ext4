# THE GUEST IS WHERE THE ORACLE TOOLS LIVE. Not the host: e2fsprogs on a
# workstation is whatever that machine has — a keg-only Homebrew formula
# on a Mac, a distribution build on Linux, a different version per
# developer — and on a Mac it is not even the platform these images are
# for. One Debian guest, one version, the same answers for everyone.
#
#   e2fsprogs   mke2fs, mkfs.ext4, e2fsck, fsck.ext4, debugfs, dumpe2fs,
#               tune2fs — the oracle tools (tests/support/src/oracle.rs)
#               and the fixture builder's formatter
#   attr, acl   setfattr/getfattr, setfacl/getfacl: what the kernel
#               oracle reads back (tests/support/src/kernel.rs)
#   fdisk       sfdisk, for the whole-disk fixture's GPT
#   util-linux  losetup and mount: the kernel oracle's loop mounts, which
#               happen here and nowhere else
#   lwext4      A THIRD IMPLEMENTATION OF EXT4, built here from source at
#               a pinned commit. e2fsprogs and this crate read the same
#               specification and inherit the same ambiguities; Linux is
#               the thing the images are for. lwext4 (BSD-2-Clause, pure
#               C, github.com/gkostka/lwext4) shares a lineage with
#               neither, so where it disagrees with us one of the two has
#               the format wrong -- which is what
#               tests/lwext4_cross_validate.rs is for. It is a portable C
#               library, so it needs a machine and not a BSD: this guest
#               already is that machine (#269)
#
# AND A RUST TOOLCHAIN, for `chore test:vm` — the whole suite compiled
# and run in here, which is how a macOS host runs a Linux test suite at
# all. It is pinned to the repository's rust-toolchain.toml, installed
# under /var/lib (the VM's own disk, which outlives a `vm:down`), and the
# build directory lives there too so the second run is incremental.
