//! Mount flow (when journal is dirty), in [`replay_if_dirty`]:
//!
//! ```text
//!   1. A read-only device: return, replaying nothing.
//!   2. Parse the JBD2 superblock via jbd2::read_superblock; clean: clear a
//!      leftover needs_recovery and return.
//!   3. Refuse a volume with a write-breaking INCOMPAT bit.
//!   4. plan = journal::walk(&fs, &jsb)?; journal_apply::apply(&fs, &plan)?
//!   5. Mark the journal clean, then clear needs_recovery.
//!   6. The mount continues, read-write.
//! ```
//!
//! Once the writes are flushed, the journal superblock gets `s_start = 0`
//! and the sequence after the last committed transaction, and the ext4
//! superblock loses `needs_recovery` (#228). Left dirty, every later mount
//! replayed the same log again and `e2fsck` reported a journal with data
//! in it. The order matters: a crash between the two leaves a clean
//! journal flagged for recovery, which recovers nothing; the reverse would
//! be a live journal Linux wipes.
