/// structures the bit describes correct once it starts writing.
///
/// - `MMP` (multi-mount protection) stops two hosts mounting one
///   filesystem read-write at once. Honouring it means reading the MMP
///   block, checking its sequence, writing our own node name, waiting and
///   re-checking; none of that exists. A reader cannot corrupt anything
///   and does not affect the other host's protection, so read-only is
///   fine and writing is not.
///
/// - `CASEFOLD` changes how a directory entry's htree slot is CHOSEN: the
///   kernel hashes the normalised, case-folded name with SipHash-2-4 and
///   files the entry into the leaf that hash selects. This driver hashes
///   the raw bytes with half_md4 or tea. Reads survive that by accident,
///   because `path::find_entry` falls back to a linear scan when the
///   htree descent misses — slower, and case-insensitive lookup does not
///   work, but nothing is lost. A write does not survive it: the entry
///   goes into the leaf the wrong hash names, this driver's linear scan
///   keeps finding it, and the kernel's htree descent does not. The file
///   becomes invisible on Linux while still holding its inode and its
///   directory slot, and `e2fsck` reports the htree as inconsistent.
///
/// `casefold.rs` implements the hash and has no callers; neither

///   quota inodes. The string "quota" appears in this file and nowhere
///   else in `src/`. A create on a quota-enabled volume charges nobody
///   for it and leaves counters that no longer describe the filesystem,

/// - `ORPHAN_PRESENT` is absent for the same reason: the orphan file is
///   read (see `Filesystem::orphan_list`) and not maintained.
/// - `GDT_CSUM` is present, and was not at first. Its group-descriptor
///   checksums are crc16 rather than `METADATA_CSUM`'s crc32c, and until
