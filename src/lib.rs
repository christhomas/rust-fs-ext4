//! ext4rs — pure-Rust ext4 filesystem driver.
//!
//! Exposes a stable C ABI (`fs_ext4_*`) via [`capi`] so FFI consumers
//! (Swift/C/Go/…) can link `libfs_ext4.a` and `#include "fs_ext4.h"`.
//!
//! Architecture (reading; the write path is in [`fs`], [`alloc`],
//! [`journal_writer`] and the `*_mut` modules):
//! - [`block_io`] — abstract trait for reading device blocks
//! - [`superblock`] — parse + validate the on-disk superblock
//! - [`features`] — feature flag inventory (COMPAT/INCOMPAT/RO_COMPAT)
//! - [`bgd`] — block group descriptor parsing
//! - [`inode`] — inode + extra fields parsing
//! - [`extent`] — extent tree traversal (leaf/internal nodes, uninitialized extents)
//! - [`dir`] — directory entries (linear and HTree)
//! - [`hash`] — htree hash functions (legacy / half_md4 / tea)
//! - [`fs`] — top-level filesystem handle, file/dir lookup, read API
//! - [`capi`] — C ABI exports matching `include/fs_ext4.h`

// `doc_lazy_continuation` disagrees with the existing numbered-list
// indentation in several module preambles; the content is fine.
