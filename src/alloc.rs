//! Block + inode bitmap allocator — planning layer.
//!
//! Phase 4 write path scaffolding. This module produces typed
//! [`AllocationPlan`] values describing what bits to flip in which bitmap
//! block + the updated free-counter deltas. It does NOT write to disk;
//! E11 (journaled writes) will apply the plans atomically under a
//! JBD2 transaction.
//!
//! Rationale: separating allocation (pure function over bitmap bytes) from
//! commit (journaled block write) makes tests trivial and keeps the
//! read-only mount path untouched. Block device traits stay read-only in
//! Phase 1; the write trait lives at the commit boundary.
//!
//! ### Block bitmap layout
//! One bit per block in the group. Bit `i` = block `group_start + i`.
//! A 4 KiB block bitmap covers `32768` blocks (one block group on a
//! 4 KiB-block fs). Bits are packed LSB-first within each byte: bit 0 of
//! byte 0 represents the first block in the group.
//!
//! ### Inode bitmap layout
//! Same LSB-first packing. Bit `i` = inode `(group_idx * inodes_per_group) + i + 1`
//! (inode numbers are 1-based).
//!
//! ### Orlov allocator (directories)
//! Linux ext4 chooses a group for new directories using the Orlov heuristic:
//! prefer groups whose `(free_blocks, free_inodes, used_dirs)` triple is
//! "below average" — distributing directories evenly across groups so sibling
//! files end up near their parent dir. We implement a simplified variant:
//! iterate groups starting from `hint`, prefer one whose used_dirs is below
//! the fleet average and has the most free_inodes.

/// the first, because the test never looked at the ones it had already
