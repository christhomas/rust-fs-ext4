# Changelog

## [Unreleased]

### Fixed

- Journal transactions carry the checksums their journal declares. On a
  `metadata_csum` filesystem every tag, descriptor, revoke and commit
  checksum was written as zero, so Linux's recovery stopped at the commit
  and a crash mid-operation was never repaired. A CSUM_V3 tag is also 16
  bytes without 64-bit block numbers, as the kernel reads it.
- Replay believes only a committed transaction whose checksums hold. A
  torn commit ends the log, as does a damaged descriptor with no valid
  commit after it; a damaged descriptor, data or revoke block in a
  committed transaction refuses the replay. The tag after one carrying a
  UUID is read where it is, and a journal declaring `ASYNC_COMMIT`,
  `FAST_COMMIT`, an unknown incompat feature, CSUM_V2 with CSUM_V3 or a
  checksum type other than crc32c, or a block size other than the
  filesystem's, is refused.
- A commit sets `needs_recovery` before its journal goes live and clears
  it once the journal is clean again, including in a superblock block the
  transaction journals. Linux replays only a filesystem carrying that
  flag and wipes the journal of one without it, so a crash mid-commit was
  discarded rather than recovered.
- Replay marks the journal clean and clears `needs_recovery` once the
  writes are on disk. It left both set, so every mount replayed the same
  log again and `e2fsck` reported a journal still holding data.
- A read-only mount of a filesystem with a dirty journal reads the
  committed state. It skipped the journal and reported the superseded
  metadata as fact; it now replays the journal into the buffer cache,
  writing nothing, and re-reads the superblock and group descriptors
  through it. A journal the replay refuses now fails the mount rather than
  being read past.

## [0.5.1] — 2026-09-06

### Fixed

- A journal entry that names a block outside the filesystem is refused
  rather than replayed. Replay writes where the entry says, so a
  crafted journal could write anywhere on the device.
- The superblock fields a mount sizes itself from are bounded, so an
  image cannot decide how much memory a mount spends.
- A directory's declared size no longer drives an unbounded scan.
- The allocator and the journal writer may not step outside the
  filesystem.
- A group descriptor's pointers are read as block numbers in this
  filesystem rather than as offsets, which is what they are.

## [0.5.0] — 2026-09-04

### Breaking

- **The C attribute struct's timestamps widen to `int64_t`.**
  `fs_ext4_attr_t`'s `atime`/`mtime`/`ctime`/`crtime` were `uint32_t`.
  ext4's on-disk base field is a *signed* 32-bit value which the
  matching `*_extra` field extends by two further bits, so the real
  range is roughly 1901..2446 — a `uint32_t` truncated everything past
  2038 and turned every pre-1970 date into a far-future one.
  **This moves every field after them in the struct: consumers must
  recompile, not merely relink.** `include/fs_ext4.h` is updated to
  match.

- **`fs_ext4_utimens` takes `int64_t` seconds, and the "leave unchanged"
  sentinel moves.** The setter took `uint32_t`, which could not name a
  pre-1970 time and — worse — wrote a post-2038 time into the signed base
  field with the epoch bits left zero. With the reader above now decoding
  those bits, setting an mtime of 2046 and reading it back gave 1909,
  from a call that returned success. `UINT32_MAX` was the sentinel meaning
  "leave this timestamp alone"; under a signed 64-bit parameter it is an
  ordinary date in 2106, so the sentinel is now `FS_EXT4_TIME_OMIT`
  (`INT64_MIN`). A time outside what the format can store, or one needing
  the epoch bits on a 128-byte inode with no `*_extra` field, is refused
  with `EINVAL` before any byte is written. Callers must update both the
  argument types and the sentinel.

  The header declares the sentinel as `static const int64_t`, not a
  `#define`: Swift's C importer accepts simple literal macros only and
  silently drops `#define FS_EXT4_TIME_OMIT INT64_MIN`, leaving the symbol
  absent on the Swift side with no diagnostic.

- **`CachingDevice` is no longer part of this crate's public API.** It was
  removed while deleting what a dead-code `allow` was hiding; the type lives in
  `am-fs-core` now, where the other drivers were already getting it. The
  functionality moved rather than disappearing, but
  `fs_ext4::block_io::CachingDevice` no longer resolves, which is why this is a
  minor rather than a patch — for a `0.x` crate cargo treats the minor as the
  compatibility boundary. Nothing outside this repo referenced it.

### Added

- **`mkfs.ext4` is published as a downloadable binary.** A release job builds
  the formatter, renames it from the cargo target `mkfs_ext4` to the dotted name
  the format's convention uses — cargo refuses a dot in a target name — and
  attaches a per-platform archive to the release, so a package manager can
  install it without a Rust toolchain. The rename happens at package time rather
  than in a downstream formula, so anyone downloading the archive directly gets
  the real name.

### Fixes

Four of these come from `docs/format-conformance-gaps.md`, which
catalogues places the reader accepted a filesystem it could not read
correctly. They share a failure mode: the mount succeeded and the
wrongness appeared later as data rather than as an error.

- **A bigalloc filesystem is refused rather than misread.** bigalloc
  moves the allocation unit from the block to the cluster, so a reader
  assuming they are the same computes every block-group offset wrong.
  Measured: with the refusal disabled, such an image fails with
  `BadChecksum { what: "block group descriptor" }` — the misreading
  caught in the act, and caught only because `metadata_csum` happened
  to be on. Without it the wrong read returns silently.

  The refusal is a named list, not "anything unrecognised": an unknown
  RO_COMPAT bit must still mount, which is the compatibility model.
  (The mask that previously claimed to control this was dead code —
  the check ignored its argument entirely.)

- **Timestamps apply the epoch-extension bits and are read as signed.**
  The `*_extra` fields were read only for their nanosecond half by
  `>> 2`; the seconds extension lives in exactly the two bits that
  discards. Every timestamp past 2038 came back 136 years early, and
  every pre-1970 date came back as one in 2106.

- **A missing or short inline-data spill is corruption, not an empty
  tail.** An inline file over 60 bytes stores its remainder in the
  `system.data` xattr. If that xattr was absent the read silently
  returned only the first 60 bytes — for a file whose size field still
  claimed the full length, so nothing downstream could detect the
  truncation.

- **A writable mount of an MMP filesystem is refused.** Multi-Mount
  Protection stops two hosts writing to one filesystem at once, and is
  not implemented. Read-only mounts are unaffected and still work,
  which is what recovering data from a disk another machine has open
  requires.

- **A truncated inode read fails closed.** The checksum verifier accepted a
  short read as a pass; it now refuses one, because a read that did not return
  the bytes is not a checksum that matched.

### Internal

- Dependencies move to `am-fs-core` 0.2.4.
- `tests/feature_matrix.rs` builds a filesystem with each feature via
  `mke2fs` and asserts the crate either reads it correctly or refuses
  it. Every gap fixed above was found by reading code, not by a test
  failing; this is the test that would have caught them.

## [0.4.1] — 2026-08-29

### Fixes

- **`mkfs.ext4 -c` no longer swallows the device path** — `-c` asks the standard
  formatter for a bad-block scan and takes no argument, but it was listed among
  the flags that consume the token after them. `mkfs.ext4 -c disk.img` therefore
  read the image path as the value of `-c` and then failed with "missing
  positional `<device>` argument" about the path it had just consumed.

- **`mkfs.ext4 -b` rejects an unusable block size before opening the device** —
  the power-of-two / 1 KiB..64 KiB rule was enforced only inside the formatter,
  which runs after the device is opened read-write and after the tool has
  printed that it is formatting it, so `-b 3000` looked like a format that had
  failed part way through rather than a rejected argument. The rule now lives in
  one predicate (`mkfs::is_valid_block_size`) that both the formatter and the
  CLI call.

- **`mkfs.ext4 -q` no longer depends on where it appears** — `quiet` was read
  while the loop that sets it was still running, so `-q -m 1` was silent and
  `-m 1 -q` was not.

### Testing

- The `mkfs_e2fsck_oracle` suite gains multi-group cases (320 MiB / three
  groups with a short final group, and 640 MiB / five groups so a backup lands
  in group 3 under the sparse-super powers-of-3 rule), and CI runs `fsck.ext4`
  against both — including through their backup superblocks with `-b`. The
  multi-group formatter path had previously been validated only by this crate's
  own reader. It passes.

## [0.4.0] — 2026-06-30

### Features

- **Multiple block groups (ext4)** — `format_filesystem` /
  `format_filesystem_with_flavor` formats ext4 volumes spanning more than one
  block group: a full block-group descriptor table plus per-group block and
  inode bitmaps and inode tables. Superblock/GDT backups are written in the
  `RO_COMPAT_SPARSE_SUPER` groups (0, 1, and further powers of 3/5/7), so that a
  damaged primary superblock is recoverable via `e2fsck -b`. Only the filesystem
  metadata is written, so large volumes format quickly. ext2/ext3 remain
  single-group entities.

### Fixes

- **Metadata-checksum & free-count coherency on write** — bitmap, inode, and
  journal-superblock checksums are now recomputed when the underlying metadata
  changes; `bg_itable_unused` is maintained on inode allocation; superblock
  free-block / free-inode counts stay coherent across consecutive allocate/free
  ops (`patch_sb_counters` was re-reading the immutable mount-time snapshot and
  clobbering deltas). Fixes `e2fsck` "does not match checksum" / "free … count
  wrong" reports on written images.

- **Write-path hardening (dir / xattr / pwrite)** — `apply_rmdir` clears the
  freed directory inode; external xattr blocks compute correct entry/block
  hashes; `removexattr`'s external-block free is journaled (crash-safe); large
  pwrites are split into per-transaction chunks so they can't overflow a single
  journal descriptor block. Directory growth refreshes the block-bitmap
  checksum alongside the BGD + SB counter updates in one cache-coherent commit.

- **mkfs 1 KiB-block & ext3 correctness** — the group-0 block bitmap is indexed
  in bit space (accounting for `first_data_block = 1` on 1 KiB blocks), fixing
  an off-by-one tail and the missing trailing pad bit; the ext3 journal's
  indirect-map blocks are counted as used. 1 KiB and ext3 images now pass the
  in-process `fsck::audit`; 2 KiB / 4 KiB output is byte-identical to before.
  New `mkfs_e2fsck_oracle` / `mkfs_ext3_oracle` oracle test harnesses across
  block sizes and flavors.

## [0.3.3] — 2026-06-21

- Renamed the published crate `fs-ext4` → `am-fs-ext4` (consistency with the
  `am-*` sister crates); first pipeline-driven release under the new name. The
  `[lib]` name stays `fs_ext4`, so the C ABI / `.a` / downstream linking are
  unchanged.

## [0.3.2] — 2026-06-09

- README accuracy pass (dependencies, test counts, version).

## [0.3.1] — 2026-06-09

- Release pipeline: drop `--locked` from `cargo publish` so it can rewrite the
  `am-fs-core` path dependency into its registry equivalent in the packaged
  lockfile.

## [0.3.0] — 2026-05-30

### Features

- **Directory extent trees beyond depth 1** — `extend_dir_and_add_entry` now
  handles directories whose extent trees have reached depth ≥ 2 (previously
  returned a hard error). Uses the same `plan_insert_extent_deep` machinery
  as file writes; allocates index-node blocks on demand via
  `plan_block_allocation`.

- **Depth-1 directory leaf-full fallback** — When the single leaf block in a
  depth-1 directory extent tree fills up, the driver now falls back to the
  deep path (adds a sibling leaf or promotes to depth 2) instead of returning
  an error.

- **Full Unicode NFD + case fold for CASEFOLD directories** — `fold_name` now
  applies proper Unicode NFD decomposition (`unicode-normalization` crate)
  followed by Unicode full case fold (`caseless` crate). Previously only
  ASCII A–Z → a–z was folded, causing lookups for non-ASCII names (e.g. 'ñ'
  vs 'Ñ', 'ß' vs 'ss') in CASEFOLD-enabled directories to miss the htree
  entry and silently fail to find the file.

- **`fs_ext4_mknod`** — New C API function to create special files: FIFOs,
  Unix domain sockets, character devices, and block devices. Mirrors POSIX
  `mknod(2)`; accepts `mode` with type bits (S_IFIFO=0x1000, S_IFSOCK=0xC000,
  S_IFCHR=0x2000, S_IFBLK=0x6000) plus permission bits, and `major`/`minor`
  device numbers (0 for FIFOs and sockets). Device numbers encoded using both
  old format (i_block[0]) and new format (i_block[1]) for maximum
  compatibility.

- **`fs_ext4_set_flags`** — New C API function to update the `i_flags` word
  (FS_IOC_SETFLAGS) on any path. Bumps i_ctime on write.

- **`fs_ext4_attr_t` extended** — Seven new fields appended at the end of the
  struct (ABI-compatible for consumers that zero-initialise):
  - `atime_nsec`, `mtime_nsec`, `ctime_nsec`, `crtime_nsec` — sub-second
    nanoseconds from the extra timestamp words; zero on ext2/ext3 inodes.
  - `inode_flags` — on-disk e2_flags (FS_IOC_GETFLAGS convention); callers
    can detect IMMUTABLE, NODUMP, APPEND_ONLY, CASEFOLD, etc.
  - `generation` — `i_generation` for NFS stale-handle detection.
  - `blocks_512` — `i_blocks` in 512-byte units (matches `st_blocks`).

## [0.2.1] — 2026-05-20

### Fixes

- **`fs_ext4_create` now writes `i_crtime`** at offset 0x90 across
  all four inode builders (regular file, directory, fast symlink,
  slow symlink). Previously the field was left at zero on freshly
  created inodes, surfacing on Darwin as `st_birthtime` = 0 and
  Finder showing "1 January 1970" as the file's "Created" date
  even though atime / ctime / mtime were set correctly. Gated on
  `inode_size >= 0x94` so ext2 / ext3 128-byte inodes (which lack
  the extra section) are left alone.

### Tests

- New `tests/capi_create.rs::create_sets_timestamps_to_now`
  regression test brackets all four timestamp fields against
  `SystemTime::now()` either side of `fs_ext4_create`. Fails on
  the pre-fix code.

### Release pipeline

- `cargo publish --locked` in the release workflow. Earlier
  publish attempts failed because `Cargo.lock` got modified
  during the implicit publish-verify build and the working tree
  went dirty; the lazy `--allow-dirty` would have hidden any real
  drift. With `--locked`, cargo refuses to update the lockfile
  during publish, so the version of every transitive dep
  committed at the tag is the version that ships. Discipline:
  any Cargo.toml `version` bump must be paired with
  `cargo update --workspace` + a lockfile commit in the same
  release prep.

## [0.2.0] — TODO

(Pre-existing release. Changelog entry not authored at the time;
fill in if it ever becomes useful.)

## [0.1.4] — TODO

(Pre-existing release. Changelog entry not authored at the time;
fill in if it ever becomes useful.)

## [0.1.3] — 2026-04-22

### Fixes

- `tests/capi_basic.rs::volume_info_flags_dirty_image` is now
  formatted per rustfmt. Shipping 0.1.2 with that line unformatted
  broke `cargo fmt --check` in CI, which in turn blocked clippy and
  test. No ABI / behaviour change.

### Tooling

- Pre-commit hook (`.githooks/pre-commit`) runs the fast CI subset —
  `cargo fmt --check` + `cargo clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings`
  — so the same class of miss can't slip through again. Enable with
  `./scripts/install-hooks.sh`.

## [0.1.2] — 2026-04-20

### ABI additions

- `fs_ext4_volume_info_t` gained a trailing `uint8_t mounted_dirty`
  field. `1` means the filesystem was not cleanly unmounted last time
  it was used (captured from the on-disk `s_state` superblock field at
  mount time); `0` means clean. Callers can surface this to the user
  and run fsck / journal replay before permitting writes. Existing
  consumers compiled against 0.1.1 remain source-compatible — the new
  field is appended and initialised to 0 via the existing struct-zero
  path in `fs_ext4_get_volume_info`.

### Rust API additions

- `Superblock` now parses `s_state` into a new `state: u16` field and
  exposes `Superblock::is_clean()`. New constants `EXT4_VALID_FS` and
  `EXT4_ERROR_FS` mirror the kernel's `s_state` bits.

### Tests

- `tests/capi_basic.rs::volume_info_flags_dirty_image` flips `s_state`
  on a copy of the no-csum fixture and asserts the ABI surfaces
  `mounted_dirty == 1`. `volume_info_reports_expected_fields` now also
  asserts `mounted_dirty == 0` for the freshly-built clean fixture.

## [0.1.1] — 2026-04-20

### Docs / packaging

- README fully rewritten. New sections: origins, a concrete
  capability matrix contrasting ext4rs with its research references
  (`yuoo655/ext4_rs` and `lwext4`) to justify this crate's existence
  as an independent FFI-first implementation, and a plain-English
  at-your-own-risk disclaimer restating the MIT no-warranty clause.
- Framing neutralised: crate is described as a general-purpose FFI
  ext4 driver; no more `Swift` / `FSKit`-specific language in the
  API description.
- `Cargo.toml` description updated to match (`FFI from C/C++/Go/etc.`
  instead of `Swift/C/Go/etc.`) and `version` bumped to `0.1.1`.

### Safety / robustness

- Mount path no longer panics on malformed images. Superblock parse
  rejects `blocks_per_group == 0`, `inodes_per_group == 0`,
  `inode_size == 0`, `inode_size > block_size`, and `log_block_size`
  above the spec-sane maximum. Block/inode arithmetic in
  `fs::read_block`, `fs::read_inode_raw`, `bgd::locate_inode`, and
  `extent::lookup` now uses `checked_mul`/`checked_add`; overflows
  surface as structured `Error::Corrupt` instead of silent wraps or
  div-by-zero panics.
- New `tests/fuzz_smoke.rs` harness: truncated / zero-filled /
  all-ones images, an xorshift PRNG seed fan, single-byte flips at
  sampled superblock+BGDT+inode-table+dir-block offsets, direct
  random-bytes feeding into `dir::parse_block` and the extent
  parsers, and an exhaustive-single-bit-flip sweep of the
  superblock sector. Every combination must either succeed or
  return a structured `Err` — never panic.

### Features

- `Filesystem::audit(max_dirs, max_entries_per_dir)` — read-only
  fsck-style link-count audit (see `src/fsck.rs`). Returns an
  `AuditReport` listing `LinkCountTooLow` / `LinkCountTooHigh` /
  `DanglingEntry` / `WrongDotDot` / `BogusEntry` anomalies. Pure
  diagnostic: never writes. Bounded work so pathological images
  can't hang the caller.
- `CachingDevice` — LRU read cache decorator for any
  `Arc<dyn BlockDevice>`. Caches only block-aligned, block-sized
  reads (hot paths: `fs::read_block`, extent index blocks, bitmap
  blocks); passes arbitrary-offset reads through. Writes
  invalidate overlapping entries. Opt-in — existing callers see no
  behaviour change. Primary target is the FSKit `CallbackDevice`
  path where repeated reads of the same inode-table / bgd blocks
  dominate directory walks.

### Performance

- `alloc::find_first_free` — scan the free-block bitmap a `u64` at
  a time once aligned to an 8-byte word. Skips full words in a
  single branch; uses `trailing_ones` to locate the first zero
  within a non-full word. 8–16× faster than the previous per-bit
  loop on sparse bitmaps.

### Build / CI

- Test-disk fixtures now regenerate from scratch on any host with
  `qemu-system-x86_64` + `libarchive-tools` (for `bsdtar`'s
  ISO9660 writer). Drop-in `bash test-disks/build-ext4-feature-images.sh`
  boots a short-lived Alpine Linux VM, runs ext4 formatter + friends
  inside, writes the image matrix out via 9p. Replaces the earlier
  docker-based path so macOS dev hosts don't need Docker Desktop.
  CI (`ubuntu-latest`) runs this before `cargo test`.

## [0.1.0] — 2026-04-18

First public release. Extracted from the internal ext4-fskit research
repo into a standalone crate.

### C ABI — `fs_ext4_*`

- Lifecycle: `fs_ext4_mount`, `fs_ext4_mount_with_callbacks`,
  `fs_ext4_mount_rw`, `fs_ext4_umount`, `fs_ext4_get_volume_info`.
- Metadata: `fs_ext4_stat`, `fs_ext4_last_error`, `fs_ext4_last_errno`.
- Directories: `fs_ext4_dir_open`, `fs_ext4_dir_next`, `fs_ext4_dir_close`.
- Files: `fs_ext4_read_file`, `fs_ext4_readlink`, `fs_ext4_listxattr`,
  `fs_ext4_getxattr`.
- Write ops: `fs_ext4_create`, `fs_ext4_unlink`, `fs_ext4_mkdir`,
  `fs_ext4_rmdir`, `fs_ext4_rename`, `fs_ext4_link`, `fs_ext4_write_file`,
  `fs_ext4_truncate`.

### Driver features

- Multi-level extent tree promotion (depth 0 → depth 1) in
  `extent_mut`, with `Checksummer::patch_extent_tail` so newly
  built leaf blocks carry a valid `ext4_extent_tail.et_checksum`.

### Build / CI

- `cargo fmt` + `cargo clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings` + `cargo
  test --release` on `ubuntu-latest`.
- `CallbackDevice` fields use `ReadCb` / `WriteCb` / `FlushCb` type
  aliases instead of inline `Box<dyn Fn(...) + Send + Sync>`.

### Known gaps

- Multi-level extent tree mutation beyond depth 1 not implemented;
  very large / fragmented writes will fail loudly.
- Sparse grow via truncate not implemented.
- `setxattr`, `removexattr`, `chmod`, `chown`, `utimens` — not in the
  ABI; reads only for xattrs.
- Write path is unjournaled. `jbd2` replay works at mount for a
  cleanly-closed journal; live transactions are not yet wrapped.

### Origin

- Imported from `github.com/christhomas/ext4-fskit@aaa63cf`.
