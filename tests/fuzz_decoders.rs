//! The stable-toolchain half of the fuzzing setup: replay the corpus,
//! then mutate it, and refuse if a decoder panics, hangs, or if the
//! suite quietly stopped doing any work.
//!
//! # Why there are two halves
//!
//! `fuzz/` holds `cargo-fuzz` targets. Those are the explorer: they run
//! for as long as you give them and find inputs nobody thought of. They
//! cannot be a required check, because how long they ran decides what
//! they found, and a fresh discovery would fail whichever unrelated
//! pull request happened to be open.
//!
//! This suite is the gate. Deterministic, on the stable toolchain, in
//! every pull request, reading the same `fuzz/corpus/` the explorer
//! does. Anything the explorer finds is committed there and replayed
//! here from then on.
//!
//! # Why the corpus is whole filesystems
//!
//! ext4 is the widest parser surface in the family: a superblock, group
//! descriptors, an inode table, extent trees, htree indexes and a jbd2
//! journal, each read from an offset the one before it supplied. Most
//! of that is unreachable from a byte slice, so the corpus holds four
//! filesystems `mke2fs` wrote and `image` mutates and mounts them.
//!
//! One per shape that changes a decoder rather than the layout: ext2,
//! which has neither extents nor a journal; ext4 at 1 KiB blocks, which
//! moves every offset; ext4 at 4 KiB; and ext4 with `64bit` and
//! `metadata_csum`, which widens the group descriptors and adds a
//! checksum in front of several walks.
//!
//! They are 4 to 8 MiB each, under the 10 MiB ceiling github-guard
//! enforces on a committed file, and nearly all zeros, so git stores
//! them in a fraction of that.
//!
//! # The journal is fuzzed at mount, not separately
//!
//! `walk` calls `replay_journal_if_dirty`. A journal is a structure the
//! format expects to be partially written -- that is its purpose -- so
//! it is parsed with a corruption tolerance the other structures do not
//! have, and it runs before anything about the filesystem has been
//! established. The `journal` target takes the superblock on its own as
//! well, but the interesting path is the one a mount takes.
