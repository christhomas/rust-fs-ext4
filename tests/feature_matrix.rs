//! Every feature bit the crate has an opinion about, checked against a
//! filesystem that actually carries it.
//!
//! G5 from `docs/format-conformance-gaps.md`. Every gap that document
//! records was found by *reading* the supported-feature masks and their
//! comments — not one was caught by a test. This is the test that would
//! have caught them.
//!
//! The contract per feature is deliberately weak: **read it correctly,
//! or refuse to mount.** Both are acceptable; what is not acceptable is
//! mounting and then returning data derived from arithmetic the feature
//! invalidates, which is the failure mode every gap in that document
//! shares.
//!
//! # Why this builds its own image
//!
//! `test-disks/*.img` is gitignored, and the existing builder needs an
//! Alpine VM because most fixtures require a real mount to populate.
//! The images here need only `mke2fs` — nothing is written into them,
//! the feature bits in the superblock are the whole point — so the test
//! builds them itself and runs anywhere e2fsprogs is installed.
