//! A hole below the first entry of a deep extent tree reads as zeros (#260).
//!
//! `descend` kept the last index entry whose `ei_block` is at or below the
//! block being mapped, and refused the map when there was none — which is
//! every block before the first one a sparse file holds. So an ordinary file
//! whose data starts past block 0 could not be read at its leading hole, and
//! the error said the extent tree was corrupt on a volume `e2fsck` accepts.
//!
//! The kernel's `ext4_ext_binsearch_idx` leaves the path at the first index
//! entry in that case, descends, finds no extent covering the block, and
//! reports a hole.
//!
//! Writing into that hole is the other half: the new extent becomes its
//! leaf's first, and every index entry naming the leaf holds the leaf's first
//! logical block. Leaving them as they were describes a tree e2fsck rejects
//! with "Logical start N does not match logical start M at next level", so
//! the keys are corrected up the path, as `ext4_ext_correct_indexes` does.
//!
//! Here a file is written one block every 16 blocks from logical block 16
//! upward, so the tree is deeper than the inode and nothing covers block 0.
//! `mkfs.ext4` and `e2fsck` judge it, from the harness VM they live in.
