# `cmd_release` is called unconditionally by `vm.sh down`, including
# from a repository that never booted anything, so "release something I
# do not hold" is an ordinary event rather than an exotic one. The whole
# of the slot's value rests on that call being a no-op.
#
# THE EXIT CODE CARRIES NO SIGNAL. `release` returns 0 whether it freed
# the lock or declined to, which is deliberate — a `down` that says
# nothing is the point — and it means a test that checks the exit code
# passes against a release that frees everything. So every assertion
# here is on whether the lock directory is still there afterwards.
#
# The third case exists so that an over-correction fails. "Never release
# anything" closes the hole in the second case and would look like extra
# safety; it also strands the slot for ever, and only a holder releasing
# its own slot notices.

# 6. A HOLDER MID-WRITE MUST NOT BE ROBBED.
#
#    `cmd_acquire` takes the slot in two steps — `mkdir`, then write the
#    holder record — so between them the lock exists with an EMPTY
#    holder file. The `sleep 1` in the wait loop exists to let that
#    write land, and it is reached only when `read_holder` reports that
#    there is no record yet.
#
#    `read_holder` used to succeed on an empty file, so the grace never
#    fired: the waiter read an empty timestamp, computed an age of 56
#    years, found field 1 empty and therefore "dead", and broke the lock
#    of a process that was one statement from finishing.
#
#    This asserts the grace by using it: lay down an empty holder file,
#    start a waiter, and complete the record while the waiter is inside
#    its grace. The lock must still belong to the original holder.
#    The assertion is on whether the WAITER ACQUIRED, not on the holder
#    file's contents: the file is at a fixed path, so a waiter that
#    breaks the lock and a holder that completes its write both end up
#    writing it, and comparing its contents cannot tell them apart. The
#    exit status of `acquire` can — it is 0 only if the waiter took the
#    slot. (`release`'s exit status carries no signal, as the header
#    says; `acquire`'s is the whole answer, which is why case 5 uses it
#    too.)

# 8. A LIVE VM'S SLOT SURVIVES, HOWEVER LONG IT HAS BEEN HELD.

#    `cmd_acquire` used to break any lock older than 90 minutes without
#    asking whether a VM was still running. A fixture build routinely
#    outlives that — `vm.sh up` and `vm-e2fsck.sh` deliberately leave
#    the machine up between invocations — so the waiter took the slot
#    from a live VM and booted a second 4 GB one beside it.
#
#    `holder_is_dead` decides liveness by looking for a qemu process
#    whose command line names the holder's directory, so a stand-in
#    process with that shape is enough to make the holder live. The
#    holder's timestamp is set a day in the past, far beyond any

# 10. A LINE THAT IS NOT A RECORD MUST NOT READ AS ONE.
#
#     `cut -f` returns the whole line for every field index when the
#     delimiter is absent, so `read_holder` parsed a holder file reading
#     `123` as dir=123, repo=123, since=123 — a valid record naming a
#     directory called `123`, dated 1970. The grace that case 6 asserts
#     was skipped for exactly the same reason as before it was fixed,
#     just through a different door.
#
#     Asserted the same way as case 6, because the observable
#     consequence is the same one: a waiter must not take the slot from
#     a holder that completes its record within the grace.
# The four-field case moved out of this list when the generation token
# arrived: four is now a record this script writes, and the upward bound
