//! A mutation refuses the directory block it is about to re-stamp.
//!
//! # The defect
//!
//! On a `metadata_csum` volume, a corrupt directory block was refused by
//! `fs_ext4_stat` and **accepted** by thirteen of the fourteen mutating C
//! entry points. Two separate reasons, and closing either alone leaves the
//! hole open:
//!
//! 1. Every mutating method resolved its path with `path::lookup`, the shim
//!    that builds `Checksummer { seed: 0, enabled: false }` — sixteen sites
//!    in `fs.rs`, all inside methods holding `&self` and therefore holding
//!    `self.csum`. `capi::resolve_path` passed the real one, which is where
//!    the asymmetry came from.
//! 2. The write engine's own directory scan is separate from the path walk.
//!    `find_entry_in_dir`, and the emptiness checks in `apply_rename` and
//!    `apply_rmdir`, iterate `dir::DirBlockIter`, which takes no
//!    `Checksummer` at all. That is the scan that finds the entry the
//!    mutation edits.
//!
//! # Why it is worse than a missed check
//!
//! Every one of those paths calls `patch_dir_entry_tail` after editing the
//! block, computing a fresh and **correct** CRC32C over the corrupted
//! contents. So the sequence was: not checked, parsed, edited, written back
//! under a valid checksum. Before the write the damage was detectable by
//! `stat`; after it, nothing in this crate could see it. The defect
//! destroyed the evidence of the thing it failed to check.
//!
//! # What this file does
//!
//! Formats a `metadata_csum` volume in memory, breaks one byte of a
//! directory block's stored tail CRC, and asserts each entry point refuses
//! it — and, separately, that the block is still corrupt afterwards, which
//! is the half that says no re-stamp happened.
//!
//! The acceptance half is deliberate and separate: the same operations on
//! an untouched volume must still succeed. A guard that refused everything
//! would pass every refusal assertion here and make the driver useless.
