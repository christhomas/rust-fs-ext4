//! The oracle tools, run where the filesystem they belong to lives: IN
//! THE HARNESS VM, never on the host.
//!
//! WHY NOT ON THE HOST. e2fsprogs on a workstation is whatever that
//! machine happens to have: a Homebrew keg on a Mac, a distribution
//! build on Linux, three different versions across three developers —
//! and on a Mac it is not even the same code path the filesystem it
//! judges runs under. An oracle whose answer depends on which laptop
//! asked is not an oracle. So there is ONE place the tools exist: the
//! Debian guest the harness boots, provisioned by `scripts/vm-setup.sh`,
//! the same guest that builds the kernel-made fixtures. A Mac needs no
//! e2fsprogs at all, and every machine gets the same answers.
//!
//! WHY IT IS NOT SLOW. The VM is booted once for a suite (`chore
//! test:oracle` brings it up and holds it) and every call rides one
//! multiplexed SSH connection — about 30 ms of overhead per tool
//! invocation, against 700 ms for a fresh connection. Nothing is copied:
//! the harness mounts this repository in the guest AT THE SAME ABSOLUTE
//! PATH the host uses, so an image at `<repo>/tmp/x.img` is that same
//! path in the guest, and the arguments cross unchanged.
//!
//! THAT IS ALSO THE ONE RULE A TEST MUST KEEP: everything a tool touches
//! lives inside this repository ([`crate::temp_dir`] and `test-disks/`
//! both do). A path outside it fails here, naming the rule, rather than
//! producing a puzzling "No such file or directory" from the guest.
//!
//! WHEN THE SUITE ITSELF RUNS IN THE GUEST (`chore test:vm`, which is
//! how a Mac runs the Linux suite at all), there is no VM to ask: this
//! IS it. The harness says so with `FLTH_GUEST=1` in every command it
//! runs there, and the tool is then spawned directly. That is the same
//! rule, not a second one — the tools run in the harness's Debian guest
//! and nowhere else; only the distance to it changes.
//!
//! NOTHING SKIPS. A missing harness, a VM that will not boot, a tool the
//! guest does not have: each fails the test that needed it, naming the
//! task that fixes it.
