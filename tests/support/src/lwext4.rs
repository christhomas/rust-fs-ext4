//! LWEXT4: A THIRD IMPLEMENTATION OF EXT4, ASKED IN THE GUEST.
//!
//! The suite already has two outside opinions. e2fsprogs
//! ([`crate::oracle`]) is a second reader of the format, written by the
//! project that wrote the kernel's, from the same specification — so an
//! ambiguity both of us read the same way is one neither of us can see.
//! The kernel ([`crate::kernel`]) is the thing the images are actually
//! for, which makes it the authority and not an independent check.
//!
//! lwext4 (BSD-2-Clause, github.com/gkostka/lwext4) is neither: a
//! pure-C ext2/3/4 implementation with no code lineage in common with
//! the kernel or with this crate. Where it and this crate disagree
//! about the same bytes, one of the two has read the format wrong. That
//! is the whole reason it is here (#99).
//!
//! WHERE IT RUNS, AND WHY THERE. lwext4 is a portable C library, so
//! cross-validating against it needs a machine, not another operating
//! system — and this repository already has that machine: the
//! fs-linux-test-harness guest, where e2fsprogs and the kernel oracles
//! live. `scripts/vm-setup.sh` builds lwext4 there at [`PIN`], and this
//! module compiles `tests/lwext4/report.c` against it in the same guest
//! and runs it through [`crate::oracle`]. Two FreeBSD scaffolds used to
//! stand in for this and neither ever ran (#269); they are gone.
//!
//! NOTHING SKIPS. A guest without lwext4, a guest built from a different
//! revision than [`PIN`], a reporter that will not compile: each fails
//! the test that needed it, naming `chore vm:provision`, which applies
//! `scripts/vm-setup.sh` again.
