//! CROSS-VALIDATION AGAINST A THIRD IMPLEMENTATION (#99).
//!
//! `verify::verify` checks this crate against its own reading of the
//! specification, so it cannot see a misreading. `e2fsck` and `debugfs`
//! are a second reader written by the project that wrote the kernel's
//! driver, from the same document — an ambiguity they and we resolve the
//! same way is one neither of us can report. The kernel is the authority
//! the images are for, which makes it the answer rather than an
//! independent check of it.
//!
//! lwext4 is none of those. BSD-2-Clause, pure C, no code lineage in
//! common with the kernel or with this crate, and complete enough to
//! mount, walk and write ext2/3/4. Where it and this crate disagree
//! about the same bytes, ONE OF THE TWO HAS READ THE FORMAT WRONG, and
//! finding that out is the point.
//!
//! WHAT IS COMPARED, IN BOTH DIRECTIONS:
//!
//!   * every fixture lwext4's feature set covers — kernel-made bytes,
//!     read by this crate and by lwext4, compared name by name on type,
//!     permission bits, size, SHA-256 of contents and symlink target;
//!   * this crate writes a tree (nested directories, a multi-extent file
//!     written in unaligned pieces, an empty file, a fast symlink, a
//!     long symlink, a directory big enough to be indexed, a rename, an
//!     unlink, a truncate) and lwext4 reads it back;
//!   * lwext4 writes a tree and this crate reads it back.
//!
//! AND THE FIXTURES IT CANNOT READ ARE NAMED, NOT SKIPPED. lwext4
//! implements neither `inline_data`, nor `large_dir`, nor
//! `metadata_csum_seed`, and it is not a partition table reader. Each of
//! those images is asserted to be REFUSED, so an lwext4 that grows the
//! feature — or a fixture that loses it — fails here and gets moved into
//! the compared set, instead of quietly never being compared.
//!
//! AND IT HAS ALREADY FOUND ONE. lwext4 reads a hole in the middle of a
//! file as physical block 0 of the device rather than as zeroes:
//! `ext4_fread` zero-fills only the leading partial block, and hands an
//! `fblock_start` of 0 to `ext4_blocks_get_direct` for a run of unmapped
//! blocks. `ext4-deep-extents.img`'s sparse file comes back with the
//! volume's first blocks in its holes. `KNOWN` records it, with the
//! question of who is wrong settled by the fixture's own recipe rather
//! than by either reader, and REQUIRES IT TO STILL BE WRONG — a pin bump
//! that fixes lwext4 deletes the entry instead of absorbing it.
//!
//! WHERE IT RUNS: the fs-linux-test-harness guest, like every other
//! oracle in this suite. `scripts/vm-setup.sh` builds lwext4 there at a
//! pinned commit and `tests/support/src/lwext4.rs` compiles
//! `tests/lwext4/report.c` against it. Nothing runs on the host, nothing
//! is installed on it, and a guest without lwext4 fails these tests
//! naming `chore vm:provision`.
