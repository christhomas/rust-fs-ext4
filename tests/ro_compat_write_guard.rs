//! A feature this driver does not maintain permits reading and refuses
//! writing.
//!
//! `RO_COMPAT` states one rule with two halves: an implementation that
//! does not know the bit may READ the filesystem and must not WRITE it.
//! This driver enforced the first half and not the second — its own
//! `check_mountable` comment says "mounted read-only", which stopped
//! being true a long time ago — so a volume carrying such a bit was
//! mounted writable, and a create updated what the driver knows about
//! and silently left the rest.
//!
//! The case to picture is `QUOTA`, which is not hypothetical: the
//! string "quota" appears in `src/features.rs` and nowhere else in the
//! crate, so a create on a quota-enabled volume charged nobody for the
//! file and left counters that no longer describe the filesystem.
