//! Format a fresh filesystem with the driver's own `mkfs::format_filesystem`
//! and require `e2fsck -fn` to pass on it
//! (`fs_ext4_test_support::assert_e2fsck_clean`; `RFE_KEEP_IMAGES=1` keeps the
//! images).
//!
//! `mkfs_roundtrip` and `mkfs_bin_smoke` already format + re-mount through the
//! driver's OWN reader, but that reader can't see a wrong checksum (the exact
//! blind spot that hid the Pi corruption). mkfs writes a large checksum surface
//! from scratch — superblock csum, the group-descriptor table, the group's
//! block/inode bitmap csums, the root inode csum, and the root dir-block tail —
//! none of which had ever faced an external checker (mkfs_bin_smoke's header
//! says so: "when one is wired up"). This is that checker.
//!
//! Two axes matter here, and for a long time only the first one was covered.
//!
//! **Block size.** The 1 KiB case uses the distinct first_data_block=1 layout
//! and a minimal journal; 2 KiB and 4 KiB use first_data_block=0.
//!
//! **Group count.** `format_block_groups` scales past one block group, and the
//! code that only runs at two-or-more groups — the backup superblock + GDT
//! loop, the `s_block_group_nr` patch and its checksum recompute, the
//! short-final-group bitmap padding, the cross-group free-block accumulation,
//! and the sparse-super powers-of-3/5/7 rule — is exactly the code every
//! real-world volume depends on and exactly the code no external checker had
//! ever seen. Every case below states the group count it produces, and asserts
//! it, so a geometry change cannot quietly collapse a multi-group case back to
//! a single group and take the coverage with it.
//!
//! One thing the default check does NOT cover: e2fsck opens the primary
//! superblock, so a backup whose `s_block_group_nr` or checksum is wrong goes
//! unnoticed until the day it is needed. `-b` makes it open a backup instead,
//! and at 4 KiB blocks group 1 starts at block 32768 and group 3 at 98304:
//!
//!   e2fsck -fn -b 32768 -B 4096 tmp/oracle/fs_ext4_mkfs_mg5_*.img
//!   e2fsck -fn -b 98304 -B 4096 tmp/oracle/fs_ext4_mkfs_mg5_*.img
//!
//! The `validate-mkfs-bin` CI job runs both forms against both multi-group
//! sizes on every push, so this is a gate rather than a recipe.
//!
//! All produced images carry metadata_csum + metadata_csum_seed.
