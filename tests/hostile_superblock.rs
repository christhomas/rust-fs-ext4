//! What a mount does with numbers the image chose.
//!
//! Every field patched below is one an image supplies and the driver
//! used as a size, a count, or a loop bound. They are patched into
//! `ext4-no-csum.img` because that image has no metadata checksums, so
//! a single field can be changed without also having to restamp a CRC
//! the driver would otherwise reject first — the point is what happens
//! *after* the field is accepted, not whether a checksum catches it.
//!
//! Each test says which refusal it expects, not merely that there was
//! one. Several of these fail either way once a read runs off the end
//! of the image; what is being asserted is that they are refused before
//! the buffer is allocated or the loop is entered.
