//! The debug run that lets the PR gate see an overflow guards itself.
//!
//! `overflow-checks` is on in debug and off in release, so a defect
//! whose only symptom is an arithmetic overflow panic cannot be
//! observed by a release-only test run. `release.yml` runs a debug suite
//! too -- its `chore test` starts with `task: test:unit` -- and that is
//! NOT the same fact as the pull-request gate being able to see the
//! defect: `release.yml` triggers on a version tag, after the change
//! has already merged. A wrapping bug merges green here and surfaces
//! only when someone else cuts the next release, detached from the
//! change and the person who could have caught it.
//!
//! So `ci.yml` -- the workflow that actually gates a merge -- needs its
//! own debug run, and this file is what keeps it there. It checks
//! `ci.yml` specifically and is not satisfied by `release.yml` having
//! one; see `a_checking_debug_run_that_is_not_in_ci_yml_does_not_satisfy_this_guard`
//! for that distinction pinned as a test rather than left as a comment
//! someone could stop believing.
//!
//! # The run lives in `chores.yml`, one indirection away
//!
//! Every CI job runs chore tasks, so a green local `chore test` is the
//! same evidence as a green CI run. The debug run is therefore not
//! spelled in `ci.yml` at all: the `unit` job runs `chore test:unit`,
//! and it is `chores.yml`'s `test:unit` task that carries
//! `EXPECT_OVERFLOW_CHECKS=1` and the `cargo test` (through
//! `scripts/test.sh`, which ends in `cargo test --features cli "$@"`). The guard FOLLOWS
//! THAT INDIRECTION rather than accepting the task's name: a `chore
//! <task>` line in a gating step is resolved in `chores.yml`, through any
//! `task:` items, and the commands found there are held to the same rules
//! as a command written in the step. See [`chore_checking_debug_runs`]
//! for the ways a task stops gating (chore may skip it as up to date, or
//! discard its failure).
//!
//! The same indirection carries the rest of the gate: which jobs run on
//! which architecture, where the fixtures come from (the
//! fs-linux-test-harness VM, under KVM, on the x86_64 `fixtures` job --
//! GitHub's arm64 runners have no KVM), and that `ci-ok` waits on every
//! job. Those are pinned by
//! `the_pr_gate_builds_fixtures_once_in_the_harness_vm_and_tests_both_architectures_through_chore`.
//!
//! # Why this is an integration test and not a module under `src/`
//!
//! Cargo discovers `tests/*.rs` on its own, so there is no declaration
//! anywhere that can be deleted to switch this off. A guard living as a
//! file under `src/` behind a `#[cfg(test)] mod` line has no such
//! protection: lose the one line and the file stays, compiles into
//! nothing, and asserts nothing, with no lint to say so. That happened
//! once already on a sibling repository's version of this fix.
//!
//! # The other half: does the debug run actually ask anything
//!
//! A workflow or task file quoting a debug command inside the comment
//! explaining it means a scan
//! that ignored comments would keep passing after the step itself was
//! deleted. And a debug step that compiles but never checks anything is
//! costing a compile for nothing, so the scan also requires the
//! `EXPECT_OVERFLOW_CHECKS` handshake that arms
//! `overflow_checks::the_build_the_gate_asked_to_check_does_check` in
//! `src/lib.rs` -- the runtime half that actually performs an overflow
//! and fails if the build let it through. This file proves the step is
//! present and asked to check; it cannot prove the build can see the
//! overflow, which is what the runtime test is for. Neither is
//! redundant with the other: delete the step and the runtime test never
//! runs at all; keep the step but drop the variable and the runtime
//! test runs, finds nothing to check, and passes doing nothing.

/// gates a pull request only if the step carries no `if:` and no
/// `continue-on-error:`, its job carries neither either, and the

///

/// on an expression that happens to be false are distinct spellings,

/// matcher on a sibling repository -- enumerating them is the losing

/// interprets conditions acquires a new defeat whenever the syntax
/// grows.
///
/// A step's other keys -- `name:`, `env:`, `uses:`/`with:` -- say
/// nothing about whether the result is read, so they are ACCEPTED. An
/// `env:` mapping in particular must not disqualify a step: that would
/// be over-strictness in the one direction that costs something, since
/// the handshake this guard looks for is itself an environment
/// variable and a maintainer may reasonably move it into a mapping.
///
/// # WHY THIS IS PARSED AND NO LONGER SCANNED
///
/// The version this replaces hand-rolled the YAML, and it was correct
/// only in the sense that it had been patched five times. Each patch
/// was a helper taught one more piece of ordinary grammar:
///
/// ```text
///   without_comment        a trailing `#`, so a commented-out trigger
///                          stopped counting as a trigger
///   key_of                 quotes, so `"if": false` stopped being a
///                          different key from `if: false`
///   opens_a_block_scalar   `|-`, `|+`, `>`, `>-`, `>+`, `|2`, `>2-`,
///                          so a block's contents were read at all
///   indent_of              the block structure itself
///   triggers: Vec<String>  whole names, so `pull_request_review` and
///                          `pull_request` stopped being the same
/// ```
///
/// Every one of those is a rule a YAML parser already has. And the
/// cost of learning them by hand is recorded in this file, twice over:
/// `key_of`'s own comment noted that the identical quote-normalisation
/// had already been added to `profiles_disabling_overflow_checks` a
/// few dozen lines above, after a quoted `"overflow-checks" = false`
/// defeated that scan -- the lesson did not travel between two parsers
/// in one file. Learning it a sixth time was the alternative to this.
///
/// The properties those helpers defended are not dropped with them.
/// Each is now asserted in `mod gating` against the parser instead:
/// every block scalar style is read whole, a quoted key is the same
